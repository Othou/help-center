<p dir="auto">If the nodes on the Turing Pi 1 board are boot looping, there are few things you should check</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Check if you use a proper power supply. You should use 12V, 5A, 60W power supply. Please read more about the power supply<a href="https://github.com/turing-machines/v1-docs/blob/master/get-started/power-supply.md">here</a>.</li>
<li>The second thing that could cause this issue is if you run apps that require a lot of RAM and the total RAM on the board is insufficient.</li>
