<p>There could be several reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>The shipping fee wasn't included in the pledge. <a href="https://help.turingpi.com/hc/en-us/articles/8536126896541" target="_self">As mentioned on the KS campaign page, the shipping will be charged via our pledge manager after the KS campaign.</a>
</li>
<li>You have added additional items to your order.Â </li>
<li>Make sure you are editing your Kickstarter order and not creating a new one. You should see a notification on the cart and checkout page indicating that you are editing your Kickstarter order.</li>
