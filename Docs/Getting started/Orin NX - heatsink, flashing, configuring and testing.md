<p>As of the time of writing this article, the official Nvidia Jetson Orin NX heatsink was not available yet as well as there's no support for Orin NX in the SDK Manager, which means both heatsink and flashing need a bit of creativity, but in the end, the whole process is not too complicated, just a bit inconvenient.</p>

<h1>Cooling</h1>
<p>To successfully flash and run the Orin NX module, you must ensure it's properly cooled. Once the dedicated cooling solutions are available, they will be the best option. For now, Xavier NX + a thermopad is a good and working well option.</p>
<p>I bought `Waveshare NX-FAN-PWM` heatsink: https://www.amazon.com.au/Waveshare-Official-Compatible-Speed-Adjustable-Height-Limited/dp/B09TF5T12B</p>
